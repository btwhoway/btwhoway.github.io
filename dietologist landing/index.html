                Your conscience for what you eat, part-time pediatrician and a nutritionist.
                My path began when 8 years ago I turned my hobby into work - I became a trainer of group programs, while
                studying at the medical university. At first it was a part-time job, and then it showed me the way to
                go. After 3 years, I became a personal trainer and began to dig deeper into the science of a healthy
                body. And I understood that many diseases can be prevented by a healthy lifestyle.
